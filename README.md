# ComboEditor
Legend of Zelda (NES) Editor for "combo" data--the vertical columns used to
construct the world. Use this utility at your own risk--see remarks.

This software was written with VB Express 2008.

# Remarks
This is a project I created fourteen years ago. It was never publicly released. 
The coding style is bad. My approach to things was bad. Some things aren't 
fully implemented.

Use at your own risk. The main reason I'm releasing it is to document what data
it accesses and how it's interpreted.

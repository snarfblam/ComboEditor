Fourteen years later not a lot of this makes sense to me...

Program to create conversion table?
	extract all combos like ZTech
	if performance is an issue, create a hash code for each combo
		don't forget to compare actual combo data if hashes match
	if no match is found, just insert __ into the table. Lets hope we dont need this. there is no more space for combos.

ADD the new combo from ZeldaCombo.nes to the mountainneers toolkit file
	(it is tile $EA/234)
Copy ZeldaCombo, Remove extra combos, and recompress, and save it, create a new conversion table
Combificator: Do NOT show message box on organizer for expanded combos; .Tag = Nothing
